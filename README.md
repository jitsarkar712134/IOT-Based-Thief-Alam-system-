Using Laser light LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) Transistor (BL548) Buzzer Resistor (100 Ω) Switch DC socket (Nokia cellphone small charging pin) Adapter (5V Nokia charger) Battery holder Battery


Creating a thief alarm system using a laser light, buzzer, LDR, transistor, and some electronic components. This system works by detecting any obstruction in the laser light path, triggering the buzzer to sound an alarm.

Components:

Laser light
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
Transistor (BL548)
Buzzer
Resistor (100 Ω)
Switch
DC socket (Nokia cellphone small charging pin)
Adapter (5V Nokia charger)
Battery holder
Battery

How it works:

The laser light is directed at the LDR.
When the laser light is blocked, the LDR's resistance increases, allowing current to flow through the transistor and buzzer.
The buzzer sounds an alarm, indicating an intrusion.
This simple yet effective system can be used as a home security system to detect intrusions.
